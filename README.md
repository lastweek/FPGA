# Cook FPGA

This repository is intended for folks who are new and want to learn something about FPGA.
This repository is a collection of useful resources and links rather than a thorough FPGA tutorial.
Traditional HDL (Hard and Difficult Language) is not the main focus,
instead, we focus on using high-level languages (e.g., C++) to cook FPGA.

Originally, this repository was started by a newbie to record his learning of FPGA,
and late made public in the hope that it could help researchers to start
their journey along with FPGA, with less pain and whiskey.

Resources collected here, or the way contents are organized, are not in their perfect shape.
This repository is still raw and need major improvements. Any form of contribution is welcomed and appreciated.

## Papers

### Virtualization

How to apply Operating System concept to FPGA? How to virtualize on-board memory and on-chip logic?
And, how is FPGA ultimately different from CPU in items of resource sharing?
Papers in this section could give you some hint.

General
- [Sharing, Protection, and Compatibility for Reconfigurable Fabric with AMORPHOS, OSDI'18](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi18/presentation/khawaja)
- [The LEAP Operating System for FPGAs](https://github.com/LEAP-FPGA/leap-documentation/wiki)

Memory
- [Virtual Memory Window for Application-Specific Reconfigurable Coprocessors, VLSI'06](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1664911)
	- Early work that adds a new MMU to FPGA to let FPGA logic access `on-chip DRAM`. Note, it's not the system main memory. Thus the translation pgtable is different.
	- Has some insights on prefetching and MMU CAM design.
- [A Reconfigurable Hardware Interface for a Modern Computing System, FCCM'07](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4297245)
	- TODO
- [Low-Latency High-Bandwidth HW/SW Communication in a Virtual Memory Environment, FPL'08](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4629945)
	- TODO
- [Memory Virtualization for Multithreaded Reconfigurable Hardware, FPL'11](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6044806)
	- Part of the ReconOS project
	- They implemented a simple MMU inside MMU that includes a TLB. On protection violation or page invalid access cases, their MMU just hand over to CPU pgfault routines. The whole thing, is quite simple. But I guess this is the first one that actually reflects the idea of a true MMU for FPGA?
	- Ideas about VM are just being reflected repeatedly on GPU, NIC.
- [Sharing, Protection, and Compatibility for Reconfigurable Fabric with AMORPHOS, OSDI'18](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi18/presentation/khawaja)

	- Invoke kernel from FPGA. They built a shell in FPGA and delegation threads in CPU to achieve this.
	- They implemented their own MMU (using pre-established pgtables) to let FPGA logic to access system memory. [Ref]((https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6044806)).
	- Read the "Operating Systems for Reconfigurable Computing" sidebar, nice summary.
